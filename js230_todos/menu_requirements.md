The program should function in the same way as the previous version
except as follows:

* When the user right clicks a todo item, display a context menu
* The context menu has three items:
  * Show Details
  * Edit Todo
  * Delete Todo

* You don't need to add functionality for 'Show details' and 'Edit Todo'
* When the user clicks the 'Delete Todo' option, display the confirmation
  dialog.
* When the user clicks anywhere that isn't the context menu, close the
  context menu
